#' Calculate time to reach quasi-stationary stage distribution from a matrix
#' population model
#'
#' Calculate the time in the projection of a cohort through a matrix population
#' model at which a defined quasi-stationary stage distribution is reached.
#'
#' Size or stage-based matrix population models (i.e. Lefkovitch models) and
#' some age-based matrix population models may be parameterised with a stasis
#' loop in the largest/most-developed stage (e.g. adult survival). The
#' assumption of constancy in vital rates for individuals in that last stage
#' typically results in flat mortality and fertility plateaus. These plateaus
#' may result in mathematical artefacts when examining age-specific patterns
#' derived from age-from-stage matrix decompositions (Caswell 2001). The
#' Quasi-stationary Stage Distribution (QSD) can be used to circumvent this
#' problem. The QSD is the stage distribution that is reached some time before
#' the ultimate stable stage distribution (SSD, the normalised right eigenvector
#' of the transition matrix). With this approach, the user can ask what is the
#' time step in the projection at which the cohort approximates its stable stage
#' distribution with a given convergence tolerance level (e.g. 95%). This metric
#' allows the user to use only age-based information from before this point. See
#' the online supplementary information of Jones et al. (2014) for further
#' details.
#'
#' @param matU The survival component of a matrix population model (i.e. a
#'   square projection matrix reflecting survival-related transitions; e.g.
#'   progression, stasis, and retrogression)
#' @param conv Departure of the projection population vector from convergence to
#'   the stationary stage distribution. E.g. this value should be 0.05 if the
#'   user wants to obtain the time step when the stage distribution is within 5%
#'   of the stationary stable distribution.
#' @param startLife The index of the first stage at which the author considers
#'   the beginning of life. Defaults to 1.
#' @param nSteps Number of time steps over which the population will be
#'   projected. Time steps are in the same units as the matrix population model
#'   (see MatrixPeriodicity column in metadata of COM(P)ADRE). Defaults to 1000,
#'   which in most cases is sufficient to reach the quasi-stationary
#'   distribution.
#' @return An integer indicating the first time step at which the
#'   quasi-stationary stage distribution is reached (or an \code{NA} and a
#'   warning if the quasi-stationary distribution is not reached).
