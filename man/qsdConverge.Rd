\title{Calculate time to reach quasi-stationary stage distribution from a matrix
population model}
\usage{
qsdConverge(matU, conv = 0.05, startLife = 1, nSteps = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{matU}{The survival component of a matrix population model (i.e. a
square projection matrix reflecting survival-related transitions; e.g.
progression, stasis, and retrogression)}

\item{conv}{Departure of the projection population vector from convergence to
the stationary stage distribution. E.g. this value should be 0.05 if the
user wants to obtain the time step when the stage distribution is within 5%
of the stationary stable distribution.}

\item{startLife}{The index of the first stage at which the author considers
the beginning of life. Defaults to 1.}

\item{nSteps}{Number of time steps over which the population will be
projected. Time steps are in the same units as the matrix population model
(see MatrixPeriodicity column in metadata of COM(P)ADRE). Defaults to 1000,
which in most cases is sufficient to reach the quasi-stationary
distribution.}
}
\value{
An integer indicating the first time step at which the
  quasi-stationary stage distribution is reached (or an \code{NA} and a
  warning if the quasi-stationary distribution is not reached).
}
\description{
Calculate the time in the projection of a cohort through a matrix population
model at which a defined quasi-stationary stage distribution is reached.
}
\details{
Size or stage-based matrix population models (i.e. Lefkovitch models) and
some age-based matrix population models may be parameterised with a stasis
loop in the largest/most-developed stage (e.g. adult survival). The
assumption of constancy in vital rates for individuals in that last stage
typically results in flat mortality and fertility plateaus. These plateaus
may result in mathematical artefacts when examining age-specific patterns
derived from age-from-stage matrix decompositions (Caswell 2001). The
Quasi-stationary Stage Distribution (QSD) can be used to circumvent this
problem. The QSD is the stage distribution that is reached some time before
the ultimate stable stage distribution (SSD, the normalised right eigenvector
of the transition matrix). With this approach, the user can ask what is the
time step in the projection at which the cohort approximates its stable stage
distribution with a given convergence tolerance level (e.g. 95%). This metric
allows the user to use only age-based information from before this point. See
the online supplementary information of Jones et al. (2014) for further
details.
