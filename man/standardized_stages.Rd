\title{Group the stages of a matrix population model into a standardized set of
stage classes}
\usage{
standardized_stages(matF, reproStages, matrixStages, includeProp = TRUE,
  includePost = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{matF}{The sexual component of a matrix population model (i.e. a square
projection matrix reflecting transitions due to sexual reproduction) —
rearranged so that non-reproductive stages are in the final rows/columns}

\item{reproStages}{Logical vector identifying which stages reproductive}

\item{matrixStages}{(character) vector of stages, values are "prop"
(propagule), "active", and "dorm" (dormant)}

\item{includeProp}{(logical) include propagule stage. default: \code{TRUE}.
if \code{TRUE}, propagule stage (if present) is given back in result. If
\code{FALSE}, it's included into the pre-reproductive stage}

\item{includePost}{(logical) include post-reproductive stage. default:
\code{TRUE}. if \code{TRUE}, post-reproductive stage (if present) is given
back in result. If \code{FALSE}, it's included into the reproductive
stage}
}
\description{
Assumes that fecundity and mean fecundity matrices have been rearranged so
that non-reproductive stages are in the final rows/columns.
}
\details{
Output indicates groupings to be used when collapsing the matrix model.
}
\note{
Dormant stages are not currently handled.
