\title{Derive survival-independent vital rates for growth, stasis, shrinkage, and
reproduction}
\usage{
vr_mat_U(matU, posU = matU > 0, surv_only_na = TRUE)

vr_mat_R(matU, matR, posR = matR > 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{matU}{The survival component of a matrix population model (i.e. a
square projection matrix reflecting survival-related transitions; e.g.
progression, stasis, and retrogression)}

\item{posU}{A logical matrix of the same dimension as \code{matU}, with
elements indicating whether a given \code{matU} transition is possible
(\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}). Defaults to \code{matU > 0} (see
Details).}

\item{surv_only_na}{If there is only one possible \code{matU} transition in a
given column, should that transition be attributed exclusively to survival?
If \code{TRUE}, the vital rate of growth/stasis/shrinkage in that column
will be coerced to \code{NA}. If \code{FALSE}, dividing the single
transition by the stage-specific survival probability will always yield a
value of \code{1}. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{matR}{The reproductive component of a matrix population model (i.e. a
square projection matrix reflecting transitions due to reproduction; either
sexual, clonal, or both)}

\item{posR}{A logical matrix of the same dimension as \code{matR}, with
elements indicating whether a given \code{matR} transition is possible
(\code{TRUE}) or not (\code{FALSE}). Defaults to \code{matR > 0} (see
Details).}
}
\value{
A matrix of vital rates. Vital rates corresponding to impossible
  transitions will be coerced to \code{NA} (see Details).
}
\description{
Divides columns of a matrix population model by the corresponding
stage-specific survival probability, to obtain lower-level vital rates for
growth, stasis, shrinkage, and reproduction. Vital rates corresponding to
biologically impossible transitions are coerced to \code{NA}.

These decompositions assume that all transition rates are products of a
stage-specific survival term (column sums of \code{matU}) and a lower level
vital rate that is conditional on survival (growth, shrinkage, stasis, or
reproduction). Reproductive vital rates that are not conditional on survival
(i.e. within a stage class from which there is no survival) are also allowed.
}
\details{
A transition rate of \code{0} within a matrix population model may indicate
that the transition is not possible in the given life cycle (e.g. tadpoles
never revert to eggs), or that the transition is possible but was estimated
to be \code{0} in the relevant population and time period. If vital rates are
to be averaged across multiple stage classes, or compared across populations,
it may be important to distinguish between these two types of zeros.

By default, \code{vr_mat} assumes that a transition rate of
\code{0} indicates an impossible transition, in which case a value of
\code{NA} will be returned in the relevant matrix cell. Specifically, the
arguments \code{posU} and \code{posR} are specified by the logical
expressions \code{(matU > 0)} and \code{(matR > 0)}, respectively. If the
matrix population model includes transitions that are possible but estimated
to be \code{0}, one should specify the \code{posU} and/or \code{posR}
arguments manually.

              c(  0,   0, 0.5, 0.6))

              c(  0,   0, 0.8, 0.4),
