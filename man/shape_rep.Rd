\title{Calculate shape of reproduction over age}
\usage{
shape_rep(rep, surv = NULL, xmin = NULL, xmax = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{rep}{Either 1) a numeric vector describing reproduction over age (mx),
  2) a \code{data.frame} / \code{list} with one column / element titled 'mx'
  describing a reproduction over age, optionally a column / element 'x'
  containing age classes (each element a number representing the age at the
  start of the class), or 3) a matrix, specifically the reproduction
  submatrix (e.g. F matrix) of a matrix population model. If \code{rep} is
  provided as a matrix, then \code{surv} must be provided as the U submatrix
  of the matrix population model.

  In case (2), if x is not supplied, the function will assume age classes
  starting at 0 with time steps of unit. If x ends at maximum longevity,
  \code{mx[which.max(x)]} should equal 0; however it is possible to supply
  partial reproduction schedules.}

\item{surv}{An optional argument to be used if rep is provided as a matrix
(the reproduction submatrix of the matrix population model.) If \code{rep}
is provided as a matrix, then \code{surv} should also be provided as a the
U submatrix of the matrix population model.}

\item{xmin, xmax}{The minimum and maximum age respectively over which to
evaluate shape. If not given, these default to \code{min(x)} and
\code{max(x)} respectively.}

\item{...}{Additional variables passed to `mpm_to_mx` when the data are
provided as matrices.}
}
\value{
a shape value describing symmetry of reproduction over age by
  comparing the area under a cumulative reproduction curve over age with the
  area under constant reproduction. May take any real value between -0.5 and
  +0.5. A value of 0 indicates negligible ageing (neither generally
  increasing nor generally decreasing reproduction with age); positive values
  indicate senescence (generally decreasing reproduction with age); negative
  values indicate negative senescence (generally increasing reproduction with
  age). A value of +0.5 indicates that (hypothetically) all individuals are
  born to individuals of age 0; a value of -0.5 indicates that all
  individuals are born at the age of maximum longevity.
}
\description{
Calculates a 'shape' value of distribution of reproduction over age by
comparing the area under a cumulative reproduction curve (over age) with the
area under a cumulative function describing constant reproduction.

\examples{
# increasing mx yields negative shape
mx <- c(0, 0, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6)
shape_rep(mx)

# decreasing mx yields positive shape
mx <- c(1.1, 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4)
shape_rep(mx)

# constant mx yields shape = 0
mx <- c(0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
shape_rep(mx)

# calculate mx trajectory first
mpm_to_mx(matU = mpm1$matU, matR = mpm1$matF)


# providing the matrices directly
data(mpm1)
shape_rep(rep = mpm1$matF, surv = mpm1$matU)
