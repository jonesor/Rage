\title{Collapse a matrix population model to a smaller number of stages}
\usage{
mpm_collapse(matU, matF, matC = NULL, collapse)
}
\arguments{
\item{matU}{The survival component of a matrix population model (i.e. a
square projection matrix reflecting survival-related transitions; e.g.
progression, stasis, and retrogression)}

\item{matF}{The sexual component of a matrix population model (i.e. a square
projection matrix reflecting transitions due to sexual reproduction)}

\item{matC}{The clonal component of a matrix population model (i.e. a square
projection matrix reflecting transitions due to clonal reproduction).
Defaults to \code{NULL}, indicating no clonal reproduction (i.e.
\code{matC} is a matrix of zeros).}

\item{collapse}{A list giving the mapping between stages of the original
matrix and the desired stages of the collapsed matrix (e.g. \code{list(1,
2:3, 4)}). Original stages may be passed as either indices or stage names
corresponding to stage index or name in \code{matU}, \code{matF} and 
\code{matC}). Names given to the elements of \code{collapse} are used as 
stage names in the new, collapsed matrix. 


See \emph{Missing Stages} for handling of \code{NA} within \code{collapse}.}
}
\value{
A list with four elements:
  \item{matA}{Collapsed projection matrix}
  \item{matU}{Survival component of the collapsed projection matrix}
  \item{matF}{Sexual reproduction component of the collapsed projection
  matrix}
  \item{matC}{Clonal reproduction component of the collapsed projection
  matrix}
}
\description{
Collapse a matrix population model to a smaller number of stages. For
instance, to compare properties of multiple projection matrices with
different numbers of stages, one might first collapse those matrices to a
standardized set of stages (e.g. propagule, pre-reproductive, reproductive,
and post-reproductive). The transition rates in the collapsed matrix are a
weighted average of the transition rates from the relevant stages of the
original matrix, weighted by the relative proportion of each stage class
expected at the stable distribution.
}
\note{
This method of collapsing a matrix population model preserves the
  equilibrium population growth rate (\eqn{lambda}) and relative stable
  distribution, but is not expected to preserve other traits such as relative
  reproductive values, sensitivities, net reproductive rates, life
  expectancy, etc.
}
\section{Missing Stages}{

The collapsed matrix will always be of dimension \code{length(collapse)},
even if one or more elements of the \code{collapse} argument is \code{NA}
(corresponding to a desired stage of the collapsed matrix that is not present
in the original matrix). In the collapsed matrix, any row/column
corresponding to a missing stage will be coerced to \code{NA}.

\examples{
data(mpm1)

# check which stages reproductive
repro_stages(matR = mpm1$matF)

# collapse reproductive stages (3 and 4) into single stage
mpm_collapse(matU = mpm1$matU, matF = mpm1$matF, collapse = list(1, 2, 3:4, 5))

# use stage names instead, and name stages in the collapsed matrix
mpm_collapse(matU = mpm1$matU, matF = mpm1$matF,
             collapse = list(seed = "seed", vegetative = "small",
                             flowering = c("medium", "large"),
                             dormant = "dormant"))
